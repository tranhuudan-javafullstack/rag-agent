# Embeddings Explained for Laymen

This code demonstrates different ways to turn various types of data (words, sentences, images, graphs, and audio) into numbers that computers can understand and work with. Let's break it down:

## Importing Libraries

The first part of the code imports various tools (libraries) that we'll use. Think of these as specialized toolboxes for different tasks.

## Word Embeddings

```python
def word_embeddings():
    sentences = [['cat', 'say', 'meow'], ['dog', 'say', 'woof']]
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=10, window=5, min_count=1, workers=4)
    print("Word Embedding for 'cat':", model.wv['cat'])
```

This function turns words into numbers. It takes simple sentences like "cat say meow" and "dog say woof", and creates a list of 10 numbers for each word. These numbers represent the meaning of the word in a way that the computer can understand. For example, the numbers for "cat" and "dog" might be similar because they're both animals.

## Sentence Embeddings

```python
def sentence_embeddings():
    model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    sentences = ["This is an example sentence", "Each sentence is converted to a vector"]
    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
    print("Sentence Embedding shape:", embeddings.shape)
    print("First sentence embedding:", embeddings[0][:5])
```

This function does the same thing, but for entire sentences. It takes sentences like "This is an example sentence" and turns them into a list of numbers. These numbers represent the meaning of the whole sentence.

## Image Embeddings

```python
def image_embeddings():
    model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
    model = torch.nn.Sequential(*(list(model.children())[:-1]))
    model.eval()
    
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
    ])
    
    img = Image.open("vector_db/1.jpg")
    img_tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        embedding = model(img_tensor).squeeze()
    
    print("Image Embedding shape:", embedding.shape)
    print("First few dimensions of image embedding:", embedding[:5])
```

This function turns images into numbers. It uses a pre-trained model (like a brain that's already learned to understand images) to look at an image and create a list of numbers that represent what's in the image. Before doing this, it adjusts the image size and color to make it easier for the model to understand.

## Graph Embeddings

```python
def graph_embeddings():
    G = karate_club_graph()
    node2vec = Node2Vec(G, dimensions=64, walk_length=30, num_walks=200, workers=4)
    model = node2vec.fit(window=10, min_count=1, batch_words=4)
    
    print("Graph Embedding for node 0:", model.wv['0'])
```

This function turns relationships between things (like people in a social network) into numbers. It uses a famous example called the "karate club graph" which represents friendships in a karate club. It then creates a list of 64 numbers for each person in the club, where the numbers represent how connected that person is to others in the network.

## Audio Embeddings

```python
def audio_embeddings():
    audio_path = "vector_db/1.wav"
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path)
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
    mfcc_embedding = np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)
    
    print("Audio Embedding (MFCC):", mfcc_embedding)
```

This function turns sound into numbers. It takes an audio file, breaks it down into its basic sound components (like pitch and tone), and then creates a list of 13 numbers that represent these components. This helps a computer understand and compare different sounds.

## Main Execution

The last part of the code (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) simply runs all these functions one after another and prints out the results.

In essence, this entire code is showing how we can take different types of information - words, sentences, images, relationships, and sounds - and turn them all into lists of numbers. This is crucial because computers are very good at working with numbers, so by turning all this diverse information into numbers, we make it possible for computers to understand and analyze this information in powerful ways.
